Read these guidelines in order to reduce syntax errors when using ChemWhiz.

ChemWhiz supports both basic chemical formulas as well as advanced ones.
Examples: CuSO4, H2O, CO2

For multiple polyatomic ions, place parentheses around the ion and remember to add a subscript.
Examples: Cu(NO3)2, B2(HCO3)2(NO3)4

ChemWhiz also supports nested polyatomic ions. Don't forget to add the correct number of parentheses and subscripts for each ion.
Example: B6((NO3)2(SO4)2)3

To enter hydrates, use an asterisk "*" and then the water of hydration formula.
Example: CuSO4*5H20

You can also add a coefficient to your formula to multiply the molar mass.
Example: 3CO2

Please note that ChemWhiz is case-sensitive to prevent confusion. Therefore, CO2 is not the same thing as Co2. Additionally, ChemWhiz removes all whitespace from formulas before analyzing them, so "Cu SO4" will behave the same as "CuSO4".

Do not include phase notations, ionic charges, or electrons when entering formulas.
